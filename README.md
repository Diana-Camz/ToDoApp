# TodoApp
## Project Overview
This project is a **Task Management Application** that allows users to **create, view, edit, and delete tasks** efficiently. Users can assign categories, set deadlines using date and time pickers, select task priorities, and personalize tasks with emojis.

The project is divided into two main parts:  
- **Client**: Built with **React Native** (using Expo) for a mobile user interface.  
- **Server**: Developed with **Node.js and Express** for backend operations, using **MySQL** for data storage.
